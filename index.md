### Introduction

It seems that as climates continue to rise, we discover more effects of it in our daily lives. While some of these effects go unnoticed, there are other times when these effects are significant and analyzing them can help us make valuable predictions based on the evidence. While there have been countless studies on the effects of climate change on agriculture, water supply, and biodiversity, we wanted to determine how and if climate change affects the global economy. With this tutorial, we will discover whether climate change has any relation to the state of the economy. For our purposes, we will only focus on climate in the United States and the U.S. GDP. We will scrape data from public sources, helping us to reach our final conclusion and the inferences we can make based on our evidence.

### Data Collection

In order to collect our data, we first need to find sources from the internet that we can scrape from.
